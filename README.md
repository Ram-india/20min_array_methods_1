# ** 20min_array_methods**

* The split() method in javascript is used to divide a string into an ordered list of substrings,
* store them in an array and return the array,
* it does not modify original array.

## 1) Day-01 split():

 `string.split(separator, limit)`

    1) separator: Specifies the character, string, or regular expression to use for splitting the string. If omitted, the method returns an array with the original string as the only element.
    2) limit:(Optional) A positive integer that limits the number of substrings in the resulting array.

## 2) Day-02 slice():


   * The slice() method returns the selected elements in an array, as a new array object. It "slices" out what you tell it to.The slice() method has two parameters (start, end), both optional.

   1) Start - An integer. This determines where to start the selection. The first item in the array
      has an index of 0. This is inclusive.
   2) End - An integer. This determines where to end the selection. This is not included in the new
   array object. This is not inclusive (the new array object does not include the end argument).
  
## 3) Day-03 slice(), substring(), substr():

  * slice()
   String method:
   The slice() method that we learned in our last lesson was an Array method. It also can be used as a
   The difference is that instead of slicing the array indexes, you are slicing the string characters.
   Remember that it has two parameters (start, end). These are the numeric positions starting with 0.

  * substring() is the exact same as slice(), with the only difference being that it can't accept negative values.
